# PythonScience
This is my collection of maths and physics based simulators, generators and games. They are all written in Python3 and mostly use the pygame libary to display graphics. I've put them all in one repository to keep things neat on my github.

List of projects:
* Planets - A simple vector based gravitation simulator.
* Mandelbrot - Generates the Mandelbrot Set.
* Perlin2D - Creates images of Perlin Simplex noise.
* MazeGenerator - Generates random mazes.
* BrickBreaker - A simple brick breaker style game.
