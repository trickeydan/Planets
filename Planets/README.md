# Planets
This is a simple vector simulator using Newton's laws of gravitation in a two dimensional environment. It generates a rather nice simulation of objects orbiting a planet. It is written in Python 3 and utilises the pygame library.
* ~~Uses realistic masses and actual constants~~
* Uses arbitary constants and masses to make an interesting simulation.
* Command line interface to change constants
* Displays a readout of quantities.
* Requires pygame
* NB: Doesn't conserve energy. Likely due to the use of arbitary constants.
* Requires Python 3 and Pygame
