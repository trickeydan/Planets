# Perlin2D
This program generates an image of 2 dimensional perlin simplex noise.

* Requires https://github.com/caseman/noise to generate the noise.
* Loops through zooming in and out to demonstrate the scale variable
* Not what I was aiming for, but still is interesting enough to keep. I will make what I was intending another time.
